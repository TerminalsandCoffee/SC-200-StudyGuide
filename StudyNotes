Absolutely—let’s gather **everything we’ve covered so far** into a single, organized, easy-to-review summary you can use for reflection and retention.

I’m going to break this into **topic sections with the Quick Memory Tips and clarifying notes** to make it digestible.

# 🎯 SC-200 Study Reflection Summary

## 🟢 Microsoft Sentinel

✅ **Sentinel Workspaces**

* **What is it?** A Log Analytics workspace + Sentinel solution layered on top.
* **Needed to deploy Sentinel:**

  * Azure subscription
  * Microsoft Entra tenant (Azure AD)
  * Log Analytics workspace

✅ **First step when deploying Sentinel:**

> **Create a Log Analytics workspace.**

---

✅ **Livestream Queries**

* **Livestream = Real-time streaming view of incoming events.**
* **Rule:**

> **Livestream queries cannot have time filters (e.g., `TimeGenerated > ago(7d)`).**

* If you see `ago()` or any fixed time range—**remove it**.

---

✅ **Bookmarks vs. Watchlists**

* **Bookmark:** Save query results as evidence for investigations.

  * Shows in the **investigation graph.**
* **Watchlist:** Static list of values (usernames, IPs) you reference in queries.

  * **Does NOT** store query results.
* **Quick Tip:**

> **Need evidence? Bookmark. Need lookup list? Watchlist.**

---

✅ **Entity Mapping in Hunting Queries**

* Some fields can be mapped to entities in Sentinel:

  * `UserPrincipalName` → Account entity
  * `IPAddress` → IP entity
  * `AppDisplayName` → Cloud app entity
  * `Reason` → ❌ No entity mapping
* **Quick Tip:**

> **Descriptive fields (e.g., Reason) can’t map to entities.**

---

✅ **Roles**

* **Sentinel Responder:** Manage incidents (assign, close).
* **Logic App Operator:** Run (but not edit) playbooks.
* **Contributor:** Full edit permissions on rules and configs—**too much for Tier 1 analysts.**
* **Quick Tip:**

> **Need least privilege to manage incidents and run playbooks? Responder + Logic App Operator.**

---

✅ **Data Connectors**

* **Collect SharePoint/Teams logs:** Microsoft 365 connector.
* **Collect Defender for Office 365 alerts:** Defender for Office 365 connector.
* **Quick Tip:**

> **SharePoint activity = Microsoft 365 connector.**

---

✅ **KQL Basics**

* **render:** Displays results as a chart.

* **print:** Outputs a single row with scalar values.

* **project:** Selects and orders columns.

* **extend:** Adds calculated columns.

* **summarize:** Groups rows and aggregates.

* **Quick Tip:**

> **render = chart. project = select. extend = new column. summarize = group + aggregate. print = single row.**

## 🟢 Microsoft Defender

✅ **Custom Detection Rules in Hunting**

* Must return **ReportId** and **Timestamp** columns.
* **AlertId** is invalid here.
* **Quick Tip:**

> **Hunting detection? Always ReportId and Timestamp.**

---

✅ **Notification Rules**

* **Threat analytics email notification rule:** Alerts about new threat intelligence content.
* **Advanced Hunting detection rule:** Alerts on query matches.
* **Alert email notification rule:** Emails you on alerts already generated (not new threat analytics).
* **Quick Tip:**

> **New threat intelligence? Use Threat Analytics Email Notification.**

---

✅ **Attack Surface Reduction**

* Blocks unsigned executables from USB.
* Blocks executable content from email.
* **Quick Tip:**

> **Blocking risky behavior? Attack Surface Reduction.**

---

✅ **Custom Network Indicators**

* Allow/block specific IPs and URLs.
* Different from web content filtering (which is category-based).
* **Quick Tip:**

> **Need to block a specific IP or domain? Custom network indicators.**

---

✅ **Suppression Rules**

* Automatically close alerts from known benign sources (e.g., lab environments).
* **Quick Tip:**

> **Auto-close alerts from specific IP ranges? Suppression rule.**

---

---

## 🟢 Defender for Servers (AWS context)

✅ **To onboard AWS EC2 instances:**

* Defender for Servers plan **enabled in Azure.**
* Azure Arc-enabled servers **installed on EC2 instances.**
* Log Analytics agent connected.
* **Telegraf agent** – optional, for Linux Azure VMs only.
* **Dependency agent** – optional, for service maps.
* **Quick Tip:**

> **AWS Defender? Arc + Defender Plan + Log Analytics Agent.**

---

✅ **Azure Pipelines Agent**

* Used only for Azure DevOps pipelines.
* **Does not** provide Defender connectivity.

# 🟢 How to Use This Summary

✅ **Review these Quick Tips regularly.**
✅ **Rephrase them in your own words once a week to reinforce memory.**
✅ **Practice identifying scenarios (e.g., “Which connector do I use?” “Which role do I assign?”).**
